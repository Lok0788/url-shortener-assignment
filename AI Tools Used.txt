AI Tools Used

ChatGPT 

 Purpose of Usage

- Guidance on how to structure the project.
- Help with setting up the Flask API endpoints.
- Assistance in writing thread-safe in-memory storage using Python dictionaries and `threading.Lock`.
- Help drafting clean and readable test cases using `pytest`.

AI-Generated Code Handling

- All AI-generated suggestions were **reviewed, understood, and customized** before use.
- Some AI code was **modified for clarity, simplicity, and better error handling**.
- Unnecessary suggestions (e.g., overly verbose comments, over-engineered solutions) were **rejected** to keep the code clean and humanized.

Final Notes

The final implementation reflects my understanding and manual effort, with AI used only as a coding assistant for structure, reference, and review â€” similar to using Stack Overflow or documentation.
